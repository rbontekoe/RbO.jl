## Introduction
I want to master the Julia programming language. To get more experience, I created the project 'rbontekoe/RbO.jl.'

Also, I decided to use Documenter.jl to create the documentation for the project, after looking at a [video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3c8Z6HBn48) that explains its features. I was impressed when Morton Phiibleht told about the possibility to test the code example automatically during the creation of the manual. The result is this manual.

For the creation of the Julia notebook, I used Literate.jl, after watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfp1WEdYfqk&t=333s).
